# United States Data Comparison
This is a tool to compare 2 sets of data from each state in the United States.

## Usage
* You can access the tool on [this GitHub page](https://theyearistwentygx.github.io/phase-1-project/)

* The top dropdown can be used to decide whether you want to compare statistics from two individual states, or if you want to show two sets of data for every state simultaneously.

* After you've decided this, choose 2 sets of data from each column of dropdowns.

* Click 'Get Data'. This will display the chosen data in two columns.

## Sources

All data displayed by this tool is pulled from [Data USA](https://datausa.io)

## Future Updates
While this project can **currently** be considered dead, this is due to it only being created as a school project. I do plan to return to this eventually, as I would like to further develop it when my time is not being taken by school. 

If you like this tool, and would like to suggest other statistics to be included, you are welcome to open an issue on the project, and I will consider adding it when I return to this project.
